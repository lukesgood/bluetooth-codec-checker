# Bluetooth Codec Checker v1.5 Release Notes

## 🎯 Major Improvements

### ✅ Eliminated All Fake Data
- **Removed fake RSSI generation** using random time-based variations
- **Deleted simulated device names** like "iPhone 15", "Galaxy S24", etc.
- **Eliminated fake signal strength** simulation and interference visualization
- **No more fake nearby devices** - only shows real Bluetooth connections

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed app crashes** caused by invalid RSSI range (-40..-80 corrected to -80..-40)
- **Resolved IllegalArgumentException** in nearby device detection
- **Improved stability** for real Bluetooth scanning operations

### 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
- **Removed duplicate device information** from Device Information panel
- **Deleted Hi-Res audio codec text** for cleaner interface
- **Streamlined panels** to avoid redundant data display
- **Cleaner radar chart** showing only genuine device connections

### 📡 Real Interference Detection
- **Actual nearby device scanning** using Android BLE APIs
- **Differentiated signal strengths** with color-coded indicators:
  - 🔴 **Red**: Strong signals (> -50dBm) - close devices
  - 🟠 **Orange**: Medium signals (-50 to -65dBm) - moderate distance  
  - 🟡 **Yellow**: Weak signals (< -65dBm) - far devices
- **Real RSSI values** displayed in dBm format
- **Variable radar positioning** based on actual signal strength

## 🔍 What's Now Authentic
- Only shows **real connected Bluetooth devices**
- Uses **genuine RSSI values** from device connections
- **Actual codec detection** without fake fallback data
- **Real nearby device discovery** with proper permissions
- **Authentic signal analysis** based on Android APIs

## 📱 Technical Details
- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Min SDK**: 26 (Android 8.0)
- **Permissions**: BLUETOOTH_CONNECT, BLUETOOTH_SCAN, ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- **Architecture**: MVVM with Jetpack Compose
- **Real-time updates**: 3-second refresh cycle for nearby devices

## 🚀 Installation
```bash
adb install bluetooth-codec-checker-v1.5.apk
