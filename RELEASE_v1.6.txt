TITLE:
v1.6 - Enhanced Codec Detection Accuracy with OS-Level Detection Only

DESCRIPTION:
## ðŸŽ¯ Accuracy & Performance Release

### Enhanced Detection Method
- **Simplified codec detection** to use only OS-Level Detection method
- **Removed unreliable detection methods** (Active Stream, Developer Options, Device Estimation)
- **Improved accuracy** based on real device testing results with actual Bluetooth devices
- **Faster execution** with single, proven detection method

### Technical Improvements
- **Cleaner logging** and error handling for better debugging
- **Reduced code complexity** by removing 60+ lines of unreliable detection code
- **Consistent results** based on actual Bluetooth A2DP profile data
- **Better fallback handling** to SBC when detection fails

### Proven Results
Based on real device testing with:
- **LDAC** detection at 96kHz/32-bit (1MORE SonoFlow)
- **aptX Adaptive** detection at 48kHz/24-bit (LG TONE-T90S)
- **AAC** detection at 44.1kHz/16-bit (LukeSonata)
- **aptX** detection at 44.1kHz/16-bit (Jabra Elite)

## Download
- **APK Size**: 7.0 MB
- **Version**: 1.6 (Build 8)
- **Min Android**: 8.0 (API 26)
- **Target Android**: 14 (API 34)

## Installation
```bash
adb install bluetooth-codec-checker-v1.6.apk
```

**Note**: This version focuses on accuracy over feature quantity. Uses the same detection method that successfully identifies real codec usage in Android system logs.
