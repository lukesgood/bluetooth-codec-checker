# Bluetooth Codec Checker v1.6 - Enhanced Detection Accuracy

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Improvements

### Enhanced Codec Detection Accuracy
- **Active Stream Detection**: New real-time codec detection during audio playback
- **Improved OS-Level Detection**: 3 additional Android API reflection methods
- **Better Codec Extraction**: Enhanced parsing with string fallback analysis
- **Extended Codec Support**: Added LC3 and vendor-specific codec mappings

### Detection Method Priority (6 Methods)
1. **Active Stream Analysis** - Most accurate during playback
2. **Developer Options** - User configured preference  
3. **OS-Level Detection** - Runtime negotiated codec
4. **Audio Manager Parameters** - System level detection
5. **System Properties** - Vendor specific properties
6. **Enhanced Device Estimation** - Intelligent fallback with capability validation

### Device Recognition Improvements
- Enhanced Sony device detection (WH-1000X, WF-1000X series)
- Better Sennheiser Momentum series recognition
- Improved Jabra Elite series detection
- Cross-validation between device and phone capabilities

## ðŸ”§ Technical Enhancements

### Active Stream Codec Detection
- Monitors 5 active codec parameters during playback
- Sample rate analysis (96kHz+ = LDAC/aptX HD, 48kHz = aptX)
- Only activates during music playback for accuracy

### Improved Reflection Methods
- Added `getCodecConfig`, `getOptionalCodecsEnabled`, `getCodecConfigPreference`
- Better codec type extraction with additional field names
- String parsing fallback for codec identification

### Enhanced Codec Mapping
- LC3 codec support (type 10)
- Vendor-specific mappings (100=aptX, 101=aptX HD, 102=LDAC)
- Better error handling and logging

## ðŸ“± Compatibility
- Based on stable v1.5 codebase
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Improved logging for debugging
- Better fallback to SBC instead of "Unknown"

## ðŸš€ Key Benefits
- **Real-time accuracy** during audio playback
- **Better Android API integration** with more reflection methods
- **Smarter device recognition** with capability cross-checking
- **Enhanced debugging** with detailed logging
- **Improved reliability** with multiple detection fallbacks
