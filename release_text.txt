TITLE:
v1.4 - Real Data Only (No More Fake Information)

DESCRIPTION:
## ðŸ”§ What's Fixed in v1.4

### Accuracy Improvements
- **Fixed codec specifications** with real-world latency ranges
- **Removed fake signal strength simulation** - now only shows real RSSI values
- **Corrected codec latency values**:
  - SBC: 40-200ms (was ~40ms)
  - AAC: 40-150ms (was ~80ms) 
  - LDAC: 150-200ms (was ~150ms)
  - aptX LL: 32-40ms (was ~20ms)

### Real Data Only
- No more fake RSSI generation
- Honest device codec support using actual device database
- Realistic quality ratings reflecting real-world performance

### Technical Changes
- Removed simulated connection quality estimation
- Eliminated time-based fake signal variation
- Updated device database with accurate codec support
- More honest capability claims in documentation

## Download
- **APK Size**: 7.0 MB
- **Min Android**: 8.0 (API 26)
- **Target Android**: 14 (API 34)

## Installation
```bash
adb install bluetooth-codec-checker-v1.4.apk
```

**Note**: This version prioritizes accuracy over flashy features. If signal strength isn't shown, it means real data wasn't available rather than displaying fake values.
